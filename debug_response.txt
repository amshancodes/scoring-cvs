        "score": 7,
        "explanation": "This candidate demonstrates strong applied AI/ML engineering experience (6+ years), hands-on LLM/NLP work, and clear evidence of building production-grade RAG systems. They have held senior roles, led teams, and have a track record of deploying scalable AI solutions. The candidate holds a relevant MSc from a reputable UK university and a BE in Computer Science. However, there is no evidence of top-tier university education, published papers at major conferences, or significant open-source contributions. Startup mentality is present but not at a founding or leadership level. No major red flags are present."
