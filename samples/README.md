# Sample Resumes

This directory contains sample resumes for demonstration purposes.

To add a sample resume:

1. Add a PDF file to this directory
2. Update the `app.py` file to reference this sample in the "Load Sample Resume" section

Currently, the app tries to load from PDF-RESUMES directory, which is excluded from the repository for privacy/size reasons. For deployment, you should either:

1. Include a sample resume in this directory and update references
2. Create the PDF-RESUMES directory and add at least one resume for the sample functionality to work

## Note on Privacy

When adding sample resumes, ensure they do not contain real personal information or are properly anonymized.
