- 1 point: 2+ years, some results, adequate coding/engineering
- 2 points: Only roles in product-driven companies count (exclude consulting or purely academic), "Senior AI/ML Engineer" title or evidence of promotion, demonstrated project outcomes (KPIs, product success), detailed discussions of model architecture work

#### Flag 2: LLM/NLP Specialization & Engineering (Critical)
- 0 points: No LLM/NLP experience OR no product impact OR weak technical execution
- 1 point: 1+ year LLM/NLP, some product impact, adequate technical execution
- 2 points: Job descriptions mentioning "Senior NLP Engineer" or "LLM Specialist", project descriptions detailing key AI product contributions (e.g., deployed transformer models or RAG systems)

#### Flag 3: Production-Grade RAG Implementation (Critical)
- 0 points: No RAG experience OR no evidence of product team contribution
- 1 point: Some RAG experience, unclear product impact
- 2 points: Statements such as "part of a team that delivered [Product Name] using RAG", specific metrics indicating successful deployment, evidence of collaborative product delivery

#### Flag 4: Startup Mentality & Hands-on Ownership
- 0 points: No startup experience OR no evidence of hands-on, product-focused mindset
- 1 point: Some startup or agile team experience, some ownership demonstrated
- 2 points: 2+ years startup experience, roles on founding teams, explicit mentions of leading projects from concept to deployment in high-growth environments

#### Flag 5: STEM Degree
- 0 points: No STEM degree OR unknown university quality
- 1 point: STEM degree from average university
- 2 points: STEM degree from top-tier university listed below:
  - **EU**: Technical University of Munich (TUM), RWTH Aachen University, Delft University of Technology, Politecnico di Milano, √âcole Polytechnique, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Technical University of Denmark (DTU)

#### Flag 6: Red Flags (Negative points)
- Studying (e.g., PhD) during the next years
- Recent basic certifications - e.g., if a candidate got recent certification of AI foundations - means limited experience
- Job-hopping, employment gaps, etc.
